Cloud

I have been using Cloud technologies for over 10 years. My experience working in large IT system providers helps me understand not only the product but also what goes on behind the scenes with all the major cloud providers.

Although cloud services provide huge flexibility and convenience, there is no getting away from the fact that they are expensive. Getting the maximum benefit from cloud services often depends on understanding the profile of the applications you are running, and how to minimise the cost of running that service on a cloud provider.

I can help with all aspects of cloud including:

    Provisioning and orchestration using tools such as Terraform and Ansible
    Cost management â€“ looking at how to reduce your cloud costs whilst maintaining your service levels
    Security, hardening and centralised access control
    Backups, resilience, disaster recovery and data management
