I am a freelance Solutions Architect, providing Startups and SMEs with consultancy and engineering services, including:

* DevOps and Data Engineering consultancy
* Implementation and maintenance of complex systems and cloud infrastructure
* Technical strategy and alignment with product roadmap and business development.
* Systems and platform architecture and design

I can also help with improving the performance of your IT department with:

* Financial planning and modelling of your IT costs
* Methodologies and best practices
* Staff assessment
* Business alignment

Many businesses don’t need a full-time technical solutions architect – however every business is likely to benefit from senior strategic input to guide its technology team and budget as it looks to grow. I can provide that expertise, either in small doses or on a project basis.

My customers are typically small to medium sized businesses who require a CTO or Platform Architect on a part time basis of 3-5 days per month. I also provide specialist system setup for technologies such as Kubernetes and Hadoop as well as leading complex one-off projects such as Cloud Migrations.
