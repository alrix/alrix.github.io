Kubernetes & OpenShift

Kubernetes is the leading open-source container orchestration system today and many organistations are migrating it as their platform providing service. By its very nature, kubernetes is very simple to use, but underneath the hood is a very complex cluster system. Off the shelf products such as Amazonâ€™s EKS make deploying kubernetes simple but maintaining, scaling and understanding unexpected behaviour in your cluster requires understanding of the underlying components.

Furthermore, there are plethora of deployment and orchestration products and methodologies out there, as well as different approaches for continuous integration and deployment. Making the right choices that suits your business often depends on the applications you are deploying, the makeup of your development teams and your roadmaps.

My experience with setting up Kubernetes and migrating entire platforms, teams and businesses to the platform can help you deliver an effective Kubernetes environment for your organisation.

Openshift adds developer and operations-centric tools on top of Kubernetes to enable rapid application development, easy deployment and scaling, and long-term lifecycle maintenance for small and large teams.

However, deploying and maintaining OpenShift clusters can be expensive. The commercial offerings available have high upfront and ongoing financial costs and the open source offerings require experienced engineers to properly implement and run.

I specialise in the deployment of production grade OpenShift clusters using the open source product, allowing your team to focus on developing your product instead of maintaining infrastructure, without incurring the cost of the commercial solutions.

Once up and running, your only ongoing cost is that of provisioning the environment. I can deploy clusters in any environment, including AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean and bare-metal.

I can also offer ongoing cluster maintenance, consultancy and training to help you and your team get up and running.
