Data Engineering

Analysing the data you collect helps you make smart decisions and drive your business forward. However, in todayâ€™s world of Personal Data Privacy and especially with the introduction of GDPR, you need to provide a secure platform in which your data science team can operate effectively, while maintaining confidence that you will comply with the legal regulations.

I specialise in providing data science environments where your team can process and analyse data using the latest technologies including machine learning and artificial intelligence. All activity is audited, all data is tracked and any request associated with individual rights can be processed effectively. Amongst others I can implement and support technologies such as Jupyter, Zeppelin, Hadoop, Spark, Kafka and Presto as well as databases such as MariaDB, Postgresql, ElasticSearch and Cassandra.

When designing such environments, I take into account your infrastructure, environment, technologies, skillsets and information security requirements. This approach to data engineering will ensure that you can have a data driven decision making process that works for you.
