Linux

I have has been using and advocating Linux for well over 20 years. Primary distributions are CentOS, RHEL but I provide consultancy, support and technical expertise for any distribution such as Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Slackware and Arch.

I can advise on best practices for all aspects of your architecture that are appropriate for your type of business, adopting a sensible balanced approach that will ensure your architecture can scale as you scale. I cover all aspects of Linux administration, including:

    System maintenance
    Automation, orchestration and config management
    Monitoring, alerting and incident handling
    Security, hardening and centralised access control
    Backups, resilience, disaster recovery and data management
